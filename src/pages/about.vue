      Rooms: - is a single-session chat for anonymous communication. Registration or authorization is not required. You can go under any nickname in any room. Or create your own unique room, share its name with a friend and communicate privately, without fear that the correspondence will fall into third hands. The trick of this application is that messages in the room you created are not stored somewhere on the server or in the cloud, they are not stored anywhere at all. I.e. while you are in the chat, you see messages that your interlocutors write to your group, as soon as you left or closed the application, the messages disappeared. And so it is for each user. Do not worry that someone on the left can come in and read your correspondence, this is not possible. First, the entire room will immediately receive a notification that a new user has entered, and second, when they log in, they will see an empty chat window with no messages. This chat is like an oral private conversation) will only be heard by the person who wants to be heard. Enjoy your use.
